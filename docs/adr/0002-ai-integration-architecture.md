# ADR-0002: AI Integration Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
AICcountancy aims to enhance the traditional bookkeeping application with AI capabilities. We need to establish a clear architecture for integrating AI services while maintaining the existing MVC structure and ensuring scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Decision
We will implement AI features using a service-oriented approach:

1. **AI Services Layer**: Create a new `/services/ai/` directory for all AI-related services
2. **Provider Pattern**: Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, local models) through a common interface
3. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable AI features
4. **Async Processing**: Implement queuing for resource-intensive AI operations
5. **Caching Strategy**: Cache AI responses to reduce costs and improve performance

### Proposed AI Features
- Intelligent document parsing and data extraction
- Automated categorization of transactions
- Natural language query interface
- Predictive analytics and insights
- Automated report generation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clean separation of AI logic from core business logic
- Easy to add new AI providers or features
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Cost control through caching and feature flags
- Maintains existing application architecture

### Negative
- Additional complexity in service layer
- Need for API key management and security
- Potential latency for AI operations
- Dependency on external services
- Additional testing requirements for AI features

### Implementation Guidelines
- All AI services must implement fallback behavior
- API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- Comprehensive logging for AI operations
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
- User consent required for AI processing of sensitive data
