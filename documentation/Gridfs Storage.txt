We would like to keep de documents in MONGODB so that we can be system independent and also have a one point for backup. 
Just backup the mongodDB and you will be fine. 

To do this we will store the documents in the DB using gridFS, and Multer ( which handles multipart documents). 
Good guide to this is : https://mayallo.com/mongodb-gridfs/

Things that need to be adapted. 
Spooling all documents from the docs dir in the project to the db. 
create adapted viewing of documents.
